>ℹ️ Notice that, to install VTEX IO's CLI, you need to ensure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) are installed on your machine.

## Verifying the installation

To confirm that the installation occurred as expected, run the following command to check all default commands available in VTEX IO's CLI.

```sh
vtex
```

### Troubleshooting

After verifying the installation, if you see an error saying that the command or program couldn't be found, take the following steps according to your operating system.

>ℹ️ Notice that this error is related to the Yarn installation, meaning that the `yarn global add` command did not add Yarn binaries to a directory known by your terminal as `PATH`. Hence, by not adding the Yarn binaries to terminal `PATH`, Yarn and its programs can't be found, resulting in an error when running VTEX IO's CLI.

1. In your local directories, find the Profile file. It is usually hidden and named after the command line's interpreter. For example: if you're using `bash`, your Profile file will be named `bashrc`. If you use `zsh`, it will be `zshrc`.
2. Once in the Profile file, add the following command: `export PATH=$PATH:$(yarn global bin)`.
3. Log in and log out of the terminal for the changes to take effect.

>ℹ️ If your command line Shell is Fish, you can ignore the step by step above. Run the following command in your terminal: `set -U fish_user_paths (yarn global bin) $fish_user_paths`.
