# Setting your app's billing model

Once your app has been developed and is ready to be deployed, it's time to think about its **distribution**. That's right: it's time to define who will be able to install your app, if its usage will be charged and, if so, how much it will cost for the interested accounts. 

To better define these topics, you must first establish if your new app should be private or public on the VTEX IO platform. 

Private Apps can only be installed by the `vendor` account, meaning the account responsible for their development and maintenance. Public apps, on the other hand, are made available to the entire ecosystem of accounts that use the platform, and a fee may be charged or not. 

## Setting my app as private

We express our intention to make an app public by using the [`billingOptions` field](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-billing-options) in the app's `manifest.json` - file of the application responsible for saving all its metadata. 

If you want to make your app private, remove the `billingOptions` field properly from the app's `manifest.json` file if it already exists in it. 

Without `billingOptions`, VTEX IO will understand that the app in question should not be made available to any account other than the one specified in the `vendor` field of `manifest.json`. 

## Setting my app as public

If your decide for your app to be public, you must also define if its users should be charged or not. 

For both scenarios, you will need to understand how to structure the `billingOptions` field and use its properties. Before executing the instructions according to the desired scenario, take a closer look at the [`billingOptions` documentation](https://developers.vtex.com/vtex-developer-docs/docs/vtex-io-documentation-billing-options).

> ℹ️ *The data related to the accounts that have installed your app and the contracts generated for each one are stored under VTEX domain. If you are interested, [contact the VTEX support team](https://help.vtex.com/tutorial/opening-tickets-to-vtex-support--16yOEqpO32UQYygSmMSSAM) to know more.*

### Making my app free of charge

1. Open your app code in your code editor.
2. Open the `manifest.json` file.
3. Add the `billingOptions` field to your app's `manifest.json` file with the `type` property set as `free`.
4. Provide a support channel for the app users, using the `support` property.
5. Define in which countries the new app can be made available using the `availableCountries` property, as shown in the example below:

```json
  "billingOptions": {
    "type": "free",
    "availableCountries" : ["*"]
  }
```

According to the specified countries, your app can be installed in any VTEX account by any admin user of it.

> ℹ️ *The `*` value stands for all countries.*

### Charging my app

 When you decide to charge for your app, you will need to add more properties to the `billingOptions` field to set the desired **billing template**. 
  
There are three possible billing templates on the VTEX IO platform:
 
- **Fixed Subscription** - Charges a fixed monthly amount.
- **Fixed Subscription + Variable Rate** - Charges a fixed monthly amount and a variable rate according to the use of the app.
- **Variable Subscription + Variable Rate** - Charges a different amount per month according to the use of the app, in addition to a variable rate also defined according to its use.

#### Fixed Subscription

1. Open your app code in your code editor.
2. Open the `manifest.json` file.
3. Create the `billingOptions` field in the app's `manifest.json` file.
4. Set the `type` property as `billable`.
5. Provide a support channel for the app users, using the `support` property.
6. Specify to which countries the new app will be available using the `availableCountries` property.
7. Establish a subscription plan for your app with the `plan` property and its child properties: `id` (establishing a plan identifier), `currency` (choosing the currency code to be applied according to the ISO), `price`, and `subscription` (both defining the subscription price). 

For example:

```json
    "billingOptions": {
      "type": "billable",
      "support": {
        "email": "support@com.br",
        "url": "https://support.com/hc/requests",
      },
      "availableCountries": ["*"],
      "plans": [{
        "id": "PlanBRL",
        "currency": "BRL",
        "price": {
          "subscription": 100
        }
      }]
    }
```

> ℹ️ *This billing model only allows a single subscription plan to be created for the app.*

#### Fixed subscription + variable rate

1. Open your app code in your code editor.
2. Open the `manifest.json` file.
3. Create the `billingOptions` field in the app's `manifest.json` file.
4. Set the `type` property as `billable`.
5. Provide a support channel for the app users, using the `support` property.
6. Define in which countries the new app will be made available using the `availableCountries` property.
7. Establish a subscription plan for your app with the `plan` property and its child properties: `id` (establishing a plan identifier), `currency` (choosing the currency code to be applied according to the ISO), `price`, `metrics`, and `subscription` (all three of them defining the subscription price). 
8. In the `metrics` array, establish your metric's `id` and also the use range of the app to apply the metric for the extra charge (`ranges`).

> ℹ️ *Note: by using this billing model, you can set one or more metrics (`metrics`) to calculate the variable rate as you want.*

Example of an app with only one metric:

```json
  "billingOptions": {
    "type": "billable",
    "support": {
      "email": "support@com.br"
    },
    "availableCountries": ["*"],
    "plans": [{
      "id": "PlanBRL",
      "currency": "BRL",
      "price": {
        "subscription": 50,
        "metrics": [{
          "id": "smsSent",
          "ranges": [{
              "exclusiveFrom": 0,
              "inclusiveTo": 2000,
              "multiplier": 0.07
            },
            {
              "exclusiveFrom": 2000,
              "inclusiveTo": 4000,
              "multiplier": 0.06
            },
            {
              "exclusiveFrom": 4000,
              "multiplier": 0.05
            }
          ]
        }]
      }
    }] 
  }
```

Reading the above code, we understand that:

-   Fore more than  `0`  (`exclusiveFrom: 0`) SMSs sent  _and_  less or equal than  `2000`  (`inclusiveTo: 2000`), each SMS sent costs  `R$ 0.07`;
-   Fore more than  `2000`  (`exclusiveFrom: 2000`) SMSs sent  _and_  less or equal than  `4000`  (`inclusiveTo: 4000`), each SMS sent costs  `R$ 0.06`;
-   Fore more than  `4000`  (`exclusiveFrom: 4000`), each SMS sent costs  `R$ 0.05`.

According to this metrics, the extra variable rate will be charged as follows:

- For 1500 SMSs sent =  US$ 30.00 *(1500 x R$ 0.07 = R$ 105.00 = US$ 30.00)*
- For 3500 SMSs sent  = US$ 60.00 *(3500 x R$ 0.06 = R$ 210.00 = US$ 60.00)*
- For 7000 SMSs sent = US$ 100.00 *(7000 x R$ 0.05 = R$ 350.00 = US$ 100.00)*

Example of an app with more than one metric:

```json
    "billingOptions": {
      "type": "billable",
      "support": {
        "url": "https://support.com/hc/requests",
        "email": "support@com.br",
        "phone": "+5521988887777"
      },
      "availableCountries": ["GBR", "BRA", "ESP"],
      "plans": [{
          "id": "PlanBRL",
          "currency": "BRL",
          "price": {
            "subscription": 50,
            "metrics": [{
                "id": "myCredits",
                "ranges": [{
                    "exclusiveFrom": 0,
                    "multiplier": 1,
                    "inclusiveTo": 100
                  },
                  {
                    "exclusiveFrom": 100,
                    "multiplier": 0.7
                  }],
                "customUrl": "https://my.com/_v/metric/billing/info"
              },
              {
                "id": "myCredit2",
                "ranges": [{
                  "exclusiveFrom": 0,
                  "multiplier": 0.5
                }],
                "customUrl": "https://my.com/_v/metric/billing/info"
              }
            ]
          }
      }]
    }  
```

Notice that the `metrics` property is key to this model. It is responsible for defining, within its array, how the additional variable rate will be calculated for the subscription plan to which it is linked (`plans`). 

When you finish entering the desired metrics in the `billingOptions` field, you must also add them on the VTEX. It is a fundamental step for the platform to correctly charge for the use of your application. To add the desired metrics:

1. Add `vtex.billing:save-metrics` to the `policies` field of the app's `manifest.json` file. If the field does not yet exist in the file, create it.
2. Make a POST call to the endpoint `https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.billing/v0/{account}/{workspace}/_v/billing-metrics` with the following body:

```api
{
 metric_id: {metricId},
 value: {metricAmount},
}
```

In which: 

- `account` - VTEX account responsible for the app development and maintenance.
- `Workspace` - Workspace being used for the app development.
- `metricId` - ID of the metric you want to add to the platform. The identifier must be the same set in the `billingOptions` field.
- `metricAmount` - Use of metrics for billing. For example: if my metric consists of charging for each SMS sent, the `metricAmount` should be equal to 1.

> ⚠️ *Remember to remove the curly brackets from the endpoint and body, replacing them with real values according to your own scenario.*

#### Variable subscription + variable rate 

1. Open your app code in your code editor.
2. Open the `manifest.json` file.
3. Create the `billingOptions` field in the app's `manifest.json` file.
4. Set the `type' property to `billable`;
5. Provide a support channel for the app users, using the `support' property;
6. Define in which countries the new app can be distributed using the `availableCountries` property;
7. Establish a subscription plan for your app with the `plan` property and its child properties: `id` (establishing a plan identifier), `currency` (choosing the currency code to be applied according to the ISO), `price`, `metrics`, and `subscription` (all three of them defining the subscription price). 
8. In the `metrics` array, establish your metric's `id` and also the use range of the app to apply the metric for the extra charge (`ranges`).
9. Declare a new array for the `plans` property, using its sub-properties to set up what the new subscription plan will be.

> ℹ️ *The metrics stated in step 6 refer to the subscription plan created in the previous step (5). Since we want the subscription value to be variable, that is, change according to the use of the app, we need to create another array for `plans`, indicating new `id`, `currency` and `price`.*

10. Repeat step 6 for the new plan: define the `metrics` property array according to the required charge for app usage.

For example: 

```json
    "billingOptions": {
      "type": "billable",
      "support": {
        "url": "https://support.com/hc/requests",
        "email": "support@com.br",
        "phone": "+5521988887777"
      },
      "availableCountries": ["GBR", "BRA", "ESP"],
      "plans": [{
          "id": "PlanBRL",
          "currency": "BRL",
          "price": {
            "subscription": 50,
            "metrics": [{
                "id": "myCredits",
                "ranges": [{
                    "exclusiveFrom": 0,
                    "multiplier": 1,
                    "inclusiveTo": 100
                  },
                  {
                    "exclusiveFrom": 100,
                    "multiplier": 0.7
                  }
                ],
                "customUrl": "https://my.com/_v/metric/billing/info"
              },
              {
                "id": "myCredit2",
                "ranges": [{
                  "exclusiveFrom": 0,
                  "multiplier": 0.5
                }],
                "customUrl": "https://my.com/_v/metric/billing/info"
              }
            ]
          }
        },
        {
          "id": "PlanUSD",
          "currency": "USD",
          "price": {
            "subscription": 50,
            "metrics": [{
                "id": "myCredits",
                "ranges": [{
                    "exclusiveFrom": 0,
                    "multiplier": 1,
                    "inclusiveTo": 100
                  },
                  {
                    "exclusiveFrom": 100,
                    "multiplier": 0.7
                  }
                ],
                "customUrl": "https://my.com/_v/metric/billing/info"
              },
              {
                "id": "myCredit2",
                "ranges": [{
                  "exclusiveFrom": 0,
                  "multiplier": 0.5
                }],
                "customUrl": "https://my.com/_v/metric/billing/info"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
```

> ℹ️ *Note that this billing model works the same as the previous one (Fixed Subscription + Variable Rate), stating one or more metrics to define the value of the additional variable rate. The difference is that, in this case, we want the subscription to be variable as well, change according to the use of the app. To do this, we add an array of the `plans` property.*

Notice that the `metrics` property is key to this model. It is responsible for defining, within its array, how the additional variable rate will be calculated for the subscription plan to which it is linked (`plans`). 

When you finish declaring the metrics you want in the `billingOptions` field, you must add them on VTEX. It is a fundamental step for the platform to charge for the use of your application. To add the desired metrics:

1. Add `vtex.billing:save-metrics` to the `policies` field of the app's `manifest.json` file. If the field does not exist in the file yet, create it.
2. Make a POST call to the endpoint `https://app.io.vtex.com/vtex.billing/v0/{account}/{workspace}/_v/billing-metrics` with the following body:

```api
{
 metric_id: {metricId},
 value: {metricAmount},
}
```

In which: 

- `account` - VTEX account responsible for app development and maintenance.
- `workspace` - Workspace being used by the app development.
- `metricId` - ID of the metric you want to add to the platform. The identifier must be the same set in the `billingOptions` field.
- `metricAmount` - Use of metrics for billing. For example: if my metric consists of charging for each SMS sent, the `metricAmount` should be equal to 1.

> ⚠️ *Remember to remove the curly brackets from the endpoint and body, replacing them with real values according to your own scenario.*
