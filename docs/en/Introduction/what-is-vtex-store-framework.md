# What is VTEX Store Framework

When comparing two or more online stores, we can notice similarities in their structure. For example: no matter which store we are browsing in, it’s common to see highlighted products in the store’s window display, along with a search bar, menus, product pages with a buy button, logo, and so on. 

This shows us that **online store components intertwine**, no matter the store’s unique identity. 

This makes the store creation process easier, allowing for a front-end development with a **single shareable component structure** among stores - and that's where Store Framework comes into play.

## Delivering the foundation needed for any storefront structure

Based on [the VTEX IO development platform](https://vtex.io/docs/introduction/what-is-vtex-io) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) technology, VTEX Store Framework is responsible for building the storefront, providing native e-commerce components, all written in JSON. 

Our components allow you to:

- Build your store's entire front in the **fastest possible go-to-market time**.
- Have **comprehensive shopping experiences** that never get old.
- Adapt these to your store's unique identity, since they're highly **flexible** and allow for a **high degree of customization**. 
- Be natively **integrated with VTEX APIs**.
- Send your store’s view events through to **analysis tools**, such as Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics.
- Evolve your code and contribute to the framework's evolution as an **open source project**, benefiting from forum discussion and requesting new features through Store Discussion. 
- **Standardize the way your team develops** front-end code.

*And much more!*
