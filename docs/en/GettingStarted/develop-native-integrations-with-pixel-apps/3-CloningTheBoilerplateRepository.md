# Cloning the boilerplate repository

One of the main steps in your development journey to create a new Pixel app is to copy our boilerplate repository to your local environment and then make the first changes to its `manifest.json` file.

By copying a boilerplate repository, you will not have to worry about the **default settings** required by the VTEX IO platform: it will import the basic and needed settings for you to start developing your new Pixel app, helping with the **standardization** in the app structure and language.

Using your terminal, clone our [**Pixel app boilerplate repository**](https://github.com/vtex-apps/pixel-app-template/) to your local environment using `git clone` + the repository's URL. For example:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vtex-apps/pixel-app-template/
```

Then, using your code editor, open the boilerplate repository's directory to perform the needed changes in its `manifest.json` file - as we shall see in the following step!
